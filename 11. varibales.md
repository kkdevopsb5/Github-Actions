## Why do we need variables (problem explanation)

Before understanding variables, imagine writing a workflow where you use the same value in many places.

Example:
You want to print your company name in 10 different steps.

Without variables:

```
- run: echo "Welcome to KKFUNDA"
- run: echo "KKFUNDA Training"
- run: echo "This is KKFUNDA workflow"
- run: echo "Thanks from KKFUNDA"
```

The problem:

1. The value KKFUNDA is repeated everywhere
2. If you want to change the name later, you must change it in 10 places
3. Repeated values cause mistakes
4. Workflow becomes harder to maintain

Another example:
Using the same file name in multiple steps:

```
- run: echo "Data" > output.txt
- run: cat output.txt
- run: rm output.txt
```

If filename changes, you must edit all steps manually.

This is inefficient and error-prone.

So we solve this using **environment variables**.

When you store the repeated value in a variable:

You write the value only once.
You reuse it many times.

## What are environment variables

Environment variables are key-value pairs used to store reusable values.

Example:

```
APPNAME: KKFUNDA
FILE: output.txt
CITY: Hyderabad
```

You can use them anywhere as:

```
$APPNAME
$FILE
$CITY
```

This removes duplication and makes workflows clean.

---

## Types of env variables

There are three types.

1. Step level
2. Job level
3. Workflow level

Each level has different scope.

---

## Step Level env

Defined inside one step.
Used only in that step.

Example:

```
steps:
  - name: Step level example
    env:
      CITY: Hyderabad
      TRAINER: Prashanth
    run: |
      echo "City is $CITY"
      echo "Trainer is $TRAINER"
```

Second step cannot access CITY or TRAINER.

---

## Job Level env

Defined at job level.
Used by all steps inside that job.

Example:

```
jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    env:
      COMPANY: KKFUNDA
      COUNTRY: INDIA

    steps:
      - name: Step one
        run: echo "Company is $COMPANY"

      - name: Step two
        run: echo "Country is $COUNTRY"
```

Both steps can access COMPANY and COUNTRY.

Other jobs cannot access these values.

---

## Workflow Level env

Defined at very top.
Available for all jobs and all steps.

Example:

```
name: Workflow Level Example

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

env:
  BRAND: KKFUNDA
  PLATFORM: GitHub

jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Brand is $BRAND"

  job2:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Platform is $PLATFORM"
```

Both job1 and job2 can access BRAND and PLATFORM.

---

## Combined example showing all types

```
name: Full Example

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

env:
  WF_VAR: WorkflowValue

jobs:
  demo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    env:
      JOB_VAR: JobValue

    steps:
      - name: Step one
        env:
          STEP_VAR: StepValue
        run: |
          echo "Workflow variable: $WF_VAR"
          echo "Job variable: $JOB_VAR"
          echo "Step variable: $STEP_VAR"

      - name: Step two
        run: |
          echo "Workflow variable: $WF_VAR"
          echo "Job variable: $JOB_VAR"
          echo "Step variable: $STEP_VAR"
```

Explanation:

Step one:
Can print all three values

Step two:
Can print workflow and job values
Cannot print step variable because it was limited to step one
